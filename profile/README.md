## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
The Famcore Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization which believes that every community has the opportunity to come together and help those in need. We facilitate these charitable activities by founding service drives that create communal ventures focusing on delivering aid to low-income families.
## Our History
In 2015 a group of high school students wanted to make a difference in their community. Together they organized an annual holiday meal drive, Hams For Fams, which operates in New Orleans. After feeding hundreds of families for multiple years, the organization decided to expand. The Famcore Foundation was founded to help begin charitable projects in cities across the United States. The goal of the organization is to create drives that further a sense of community for a specific area while delivering aid to low-income families.
## Open Source
We are currently exploring new technologies to use to enchance our abilities to carry out the drives which we operate. As we put these in use, we plan on open sourcing ones which we see benefiting the community. After all, giving back to the community is what Famcore is all about.
## Become a Sponsor
As a nonprofit focused on giving back everything we have and more to the community, money is quite tight around here. Donating can seriously help advance our charities. If you would like to donate, please email [owen@ogaspard.com](mailto:owen@ogaspard.com) or donate online at [hamsforfams.org](https://www.hamsforfams.org/new-orleans-drive.html) (NOTE: This is only to one specific project. We will migrate to GitHub Sponsors for sponsoring here, but for now please use this).
